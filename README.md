# sadies-sweaters

This project explores a dataset of 10k sweater patterns retrieved from Ravelry.com. It may be of interest to Ravelry users looking to better understand what pattern attributes drive interest in highly-rated sweater patterns, developers looking to get started with the Ravelry API, or fiber arts aficionados in general. 

The imaginary protaganist of this project is Sadie, an amateur pattern designer who posts her patterns on Ravelry, a global platform for the fiber arts community that allows users to discover new patterns, sell or share their own patterns, post about their fiber arts projects, and engage in discussion surrounding their work. As of this writing, there are upwards of 1.3 million patterns available on Ravelry, some free, some for purchase. Sadie already sells patterns for small projects, such as hats and scarves, but she wants to expand her shop to include larger works, starting with sweaters. Before investing her effort into developing and marketing her first pattern, she hopes to understand what factors will help her generate the most interest in her work. In this project, I will retrieve a sample of highly-rated sweater patterns using the Ravelry API, conduct an exploratory analysis, and make recommendations for Sadie to take into account when developing her first sweater pattern. The project is presented in two sections: 

Chapter One: Retrieve, Clean, and Organize Data

Chapter Two: Exploratory Data Analysis
